# THIS
The `this` keyword in Java is a reference to the current object — the object whose method or constructor is being called. Here are some common uses of the `this` keyword:

1. **Distinguishing Instance Variables from Local Variables**: When instance variables and local variables have the same name, the `this` keyword is used to refer to the instance variables.

2. **Invoking Instance Methods**: The `this` keyword can be used to call another method within the same class.

3. **Invoking Constructors**: The `this()` syntax can be used to call another constructor from within a constructor in the same class.

4. **Returning the Current Class Instance**: It can be used to return the current class instance from a method.

### Example Usage in a Program

Here’s an example program that demonstrates various uses of the `this` keyword:

### Employee.java

```java
public class Employee {
    private int id;
    private String name;
    private double salary;

    // Constructor with parameters
    public Employee(int id, String name, double salary) {
        this.id = id;           // Distinguishing instance variables from local variables
        this.name = name;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    // Method to set employee details
    public void setEmployeeDetails(int id, String name, double salary) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    // Method to display employee details
    public void displayEmployeeDetails() {
        System.out.println("Employee ID: " + this.id);
        System.out.println("Employee Name: " + this.name);
        System.out.println("Employee Salary: " + this.salary);
    }

    // Method to get the current instance of the class
    public Employee getEmployee() {
        return this;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an employee object
        Employee emp = new Employee(1, "John Doe", 50000);
        emp.displayEmployeeDetails();

        // Setting new employee details using this keyword
        emp.setEmployeeDetails(2, "Jane Smith", 60000);
        emp.displayEmployeeDetails();

        // Returning the current instance using this keyword
        Employee emp2 = emp.getEmployee();
        emp2.displayEmployeeDetails();
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Constructor with Parameters**: The constructor uses the `this` keyword to distinguish instance variables (`id`, `name`, `salary`) from local variables with the same names.
   
2. **setEmployeeDetails Method**: This method uses the `this` keyword to set instance variables with new values provided as parameters.

3. **displayEmployeeDetails Method**: This method uses the `this` keyword to refer to instance variables when printing their values.

4. **getEmployee Method**: This method returns the current instance of the `Employee` class using the `this` keyword.

5. **main Method**: 
    - An `Employee` object `emp` is created using the constructor, and its details are displayed.
    - The `setEmployeeDetails` method is called to change the employee’s details, and they are displayed again.
    - The `getEmployee` method is used to get the current instance of the `Employee` object, and its details are displayed.

### How to Run

1. Save the code in a file named `Employee.java`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
3. Compile the program using the command:
   ```sh
   javac Employee.java
   ```
4. Run the program using the command:
   ```sh
   java Employee
   ```

This example demonstrates various uses of the `this` keyword, including distinguishing between instance and local variables, invoking methods, and returning the current class instance.
